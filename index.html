				<h1>Hi, I'm Katie </h1>
					<img src="myface.png" alt= "my face" class="img-circle" width="100px">
						<p>I'm from <strong>California</strong> but grew up partially in Virginia. I am currently undertaking my MSc in International Development and Humanitarian Emergencies. I'm passionate about good music, creating social change, and living each day with joy.</p>

			<h3>Gendered Experiences in Humanitarian Responses</h3>
					<p>I am interested in many different subjects including tech, gender identities, and their intersection with the delivery of aid, and am always looking for the next exciting opportunity to expand my mind beyond school.</p>

				<h3>Good Music</h3>
					<p>I have a radio show every Tuesday with lots of funky new finds, but check out my spotify below. I love finding new artists and making playlists to commemorate the places and people I love. I also like podcasts that speak about politics and design, as well as anything that can make me laugh.</p>
